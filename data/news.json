            "content": "<p>All life is made up of cells several magnitudes smaller than a grain of salt. Their seemingly simple-looking structures mask the intricate and complex molecular activity that enables them to carry out the functions that sustain life. Researchers are beginning to be able to visualize this activity to a level of detail they haven’t been able to before.</p><p>Biological structures can be visualized by either starting at the level of the whole organism and working down, or starting at the level of single atoms and working up. However, there has been a resolution gap between a cell’s smallest structures, such as the cytoskeleton that supports the cell’s shape, and its largest structures, such as the ribosomes that make proteins in cells.</p><p>By analogy of Google Maps, while scientists have been able to see entire cities and individual houses, they did not have the tools to see how the houses came together to make up neighborhoods. Seeing these neighborhood-level details is essential to being able to understand how individual components work together in the environment of a cell.</p><p>New tools are steadily bridging this gap. And ongoing development of one particular technique, cryo-electron tomography, or cryo-ET, has the potential to deepen how researchers study and understand how cells function in health and disease.</p><p>As the former editor-in-chief of Science magazine and as a researcher who has studied hard-to-visualize large protein structures for decades, I have witnessed astounding progress in the development of tools that can determine biological structures in detail. Just as it becomes easier to understand how complicated systems work when you know what they look like, understanding how biological structures fit together in a cell is key to understanding how organisms function.</p><p><b>A brief history of microscopy</b></p><p>In the 17th century, light microscopy first revealed the existence of cells. In the 20th century, electron microscopy offered even greater detail, revealing the elaborate structures within cells, including organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum, a complex network of membranes that play key roles in protein synthesis and transport.</p><p>From the 1940s to 1960s, biochemists worked to separate cells into their molecular components and learn how to determine the 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules at or near atomic resolution. This was first done using X-ray crystallography to visualize the structure of myoglobin, a protein that supplies oxygen to muscles.</p<p>Over the past decade, techniques based on nuclear magnetic resonance, which produces images based on how atoms interact in a magnetic field, and cryo-electron microscopy have rapidly increased the number and complexity of the structures scientists can visualize.</p><p><b>What is cryo-EM and cryo-ET?</b></p><p>Cryo-electron microscopy, or cryo-EM, uses a camera to detect how a beam of electrons is deflected as the electrons pass through a sample to visualize structures at the molecular level. Samples are rapidly frozen to protect them from radiation damage. Detailed models of the structure of interest are made by taking multiple images of individual molecules and averaging them into a 3D structure.</p><p>Cryo-ET shares similar components with cryo-EM but uses different methods. Because most cells are too thick to be imaged clearly, a region of interest in a cell is first thinned by using an ion beam. The sample is then tilted to take multiple pictures of it at different angles, analogous to a CT scan of a body part – although in this case the imaging system itself is tilted, rather than the patient. These images are then combined by a computer to produce a 3D image of a portion of the cell.</p><p>The resolution of this image is high enough that researchers – or computer programs – can identify the individual components of different structures in a cell. Researchers have used this approach, for example, to show how proteins move and are degraded inside an algal cell.</p><p>Many of the steps researchers once had to do manually to determine the structures of cells are becoming automated, allowing scientists to identify new structures at vastly higher speeds. For example, combining cryo-EM with artificial intelligence programs like AlphaFold can facilitate image interpretation by predicting protein structures that have not yet been characterized.</p><p><b>Understanding cell structure and function</b></p><p>As imaging methods and workflows improve, researchers will be able to tackle some key questions in cell biology with different strategies.</p><p>The first step is to decide what cells and which regions within those cells to study. Another visualization technique called correlated light and electron microscopy, or CLEM, uses fluorescent tags to help locate regions where interesting processes are taking place in living cells.</p><p>Comparing the genetic difference between cells can provide additional insight. Scientists can look at cells that are unable to carry out particular functions and see how this is reflected in their structure. This approach can also help researchers study how cells interact with each other.</p><p>Cryo-ET is likely to remain a specialized tool for some time. But further technological developments and increasing accessibility will allow the scientific community to examine the link between cellular structure and function at previously inaccessible levels of detail. I anticipate seeing new theories on how we understand cells, moving from disorganized bags of molecules to intricately organized and dynamic systems.</p>"

            "content": "<p>The summer of 1985 is oppressive around the medieval Italian town of Gubbio. Thick heat is held captive in the wooded ravines and the windless slopes that climb and crawl across Umbria and on to the foothills of the Apennines. A short winding drive into the hills behind the town is the Libera Università di Alcatraz, a secluded retreat that is in the process of establishing itself as a gathering place for artists, writers and thinkers – a place where they can escape to nature and create.</p><p>In the Italian fashion, not everything is up and operating. Buildings stand half-finished. The swimming pool has been drained so a mural of a dragon can be painted on the bottom. But somehow the place works. Guests commune with their muses during the day, then congregate for meals on the terrace in the still, warm evenings to enjoy rustic fare prepared from local ingredients, washed down with red wine and tales from the assembled creatives.</p><p>The enterprise is run by Jacopo Fo, 30 years old and turning his hand to every aspect of the business, including the swimming-pool dragon. Until the artwork is finished, the pool can’t be filled to give the guests some respite from the relentless summer heat.</p><p>Amid the dust haze and the fireflies that swarm the air, an unlikely gathering is taking place. Jacopo’s parents are in town: Dario Fo and Franca Rame. They are setting up camp at Jacopo’s enclave to rehearse a new play.</p><p>Fo and Rame are Italian cultural royalty. It is still 12 years until actor and playwright Fo will be recognised with the Nobel Prize for Literature, but he is already well-established as a national treasure. His groundbreaking work in commedia dell’arte flipped the nature of theatre. His plays present characters as grotesques who directly address the audience. Their anarchic asides are an assault on classical theatre’s embrace of the heroic lead.</p><p>Fo’s new play – Elizabeth: Almost by Chance a Woman – will be performed by a drama company from Finland. It is due to premiere at the prestigious Tampere Theatre Festival in a matter of weeks.</p><p>The play is incomplete.</p><p>Fo speaks no Finnish.</p><p>The Finns speak no Italian.</p><p>An interpreter is hired to make sense of Fo’s instructions for the actors and the many rewrites that are taking place on a daily basis. Her name is Aira Pohjanvaara-Buffa. And since she is going to be camped out in the Umbrian woods for a month or so, she invites along her new partner. He is a respected but still mostly unknown British novelist by the name of Barry Unsworth.</p><p>At this point in his career, Unsworth had attracted a small but enthusiastic readership for his historical fiction. Seven years later, he will win the Booker Prize for Sacred Hunger, his novel set amid the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade.</p><p>So, from late June to mid-July of 1985, a future Nobel laureate and a future Booker Prize winner co-exist in the peace and bucolic calm of the Umbrian woods.</p><p>The rehearsals are a fiasco.</p><p>On the first day, the actors arrive drunk from the airport. The rehearsal stage is still to be built. Fo changes his script daily, hourly – often in the wings as the actors wait for fresh lines to be written for them. There are clashes between the traditional approach of the Finns and the anarchic methods of Fo and Rame. The lead actor is laid low with sunstroke. The director has brought his youthful boyfriend with him, and the young man starts to take an interest in some of the young women of the theatre company. Tempers run short in the unrelenting heat.</p><p>All the while, Unsworth keeps a meticulous diary, documenting the artistic approach of the enigmatic Fo, as well as the behind-the-scenes shambles of a production that seems destined for disaster.</p><p>For decades, the journal was forgotten. Bundled among the author’s papers and correspondence, it eventually found a home in the archives of the Harry Ransom Centre at the University of Texas in Austin. The diary is in Box 12, Folder 6 of the Unsworth papers. Its observations are written in clear cursive in what appears to be blue biro, with occasional red annotations.</p><p>It makes for sometimes brutal reading.</p><p>The journal provides a first person account of the creative process of one of the 20th century’s lions of theatre, in all its chaotic glory. Though it is a simple linear account of events, Unsworth manages to pen a compelling narrative and create fully realised characters.</p><p><b>Great promise</b></p><p>As with all such creative ventures, it starts with great promise.</p><p>June 20th – Drove from Rome to the Liberia Università di Alcatraz which is situated some few kilometres from Gubbio, and not far from Perugia. Gentle green hills of Umbria with the darker, higher slopes of Apennines behind. Walled hilltop towns. Scale of nearer hills small enough to be manageable but dramatically steep gorges, often thickly wooded. Alcatraz itself (near to hamlet of Santa Cristina) set in green hilly country 6000 metres above sea level.</p><p>But very quickly Unsworth senses some fragility in the foundations of the enterprise that lies ahead.</p><p>Of the Finnish company met at Rome one was very drunk already – another slightly. They had been drinking on the plane […] They both continued to drink steadily but the tight-featured one remained just short of being staggering drunk while the fair haired – more sensitive one I think – became helplessly drunk by evening, hardly able to talk.</p><p>This caused and still causes worry to Willi, who is the director of the Company (They are from Tampere, about 200 miles from Helsinki.) If they are not dealt with severely they could well fall into a pattern of drinking which could make them unfit for work and seriously prejudice progress of the play.</p><p>Even in his diary, it seems, Unsworth is not averse to a bit of dramatic foreshadowing. The future Booker winner is curious about the legend of Fo and whether the myth of the man measures up against the actuality. His descriptions, both of physique and psyche, are forensic.</p>"

            "link": "nobel-economics-prize-insights-into-financial-contagion-changed-how-central-banks-react-during-a-crisis",
            "content": "<p>This year’s Nobel prize in economics, known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences, has gone to Douglas Diamond, Philip Dybvig and former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke for their work on banks and how they relate to financial crises.</p><p>To explain the work and why it matters, we talked to Elena Carletti, a Professor of Finance at Bocconi University in Milan.</p><p><b>Why have Diamond, Bernanke and Dybvig been awarded the prize?</b></p><p>The works by Diamond and Dybvig essentially explained why banks exist and the role they play in the economy by channelling savings from individuals into productive investments. Essentially, banks play two roles. On the one hand, they monitor borrowers within the economy. On the other, they provide liquidity to individuals, who don’t know what they will need to buy in future, and this can make them averse to depositing money in case it’s not available when they need it. Banks smooth out this aversion by providing us with the assurance that we will be able to take out our money when it’s required.</p><p>The problem is that by providing this assurance, banks are also vulnerable to crises even at times when their finances are healthy. This occurs when individual depositors worry that many other depositors are removing their money from the bank. This then gives them an incentive to remove money themselves, which can lead to a panic that causes a bank run.</p><p>Ben Bernanke fed into this by looking at bank behaviour during the great depression of the 1930s, and showed that bank runs during the depression was the decisive factor in making the crisis longer and deeper than it otherwise would have been.</p><p><b>The observations behind the Nobel win seem fairly straightforward compared to previous years. Why are they so important?</b></p><p>It’s the idea that banks that are otherwise financially sound can nevertheless be vulnerable because of panicking depositors. Or, in cases such as during the global financial crisis of 2007-09, it can be a combination of the two, where there is a problem with a bank’s fundamentals but it is exacerbated by panic.</p><p>Having recognised the intrinsic vulnerability of healthy banks, it was then possible to start thinking about policies to alleviate that risk, such as depositor insurance and reassuring everyone that the central bank will step in as the lender of last resort.</p><p>In a bank run caused by liquidity (panic) rather than insolvency, an announcement from the government or central bank is likely to be enough to solve the problem on its own – often without the need for any deposit insurance even being paid out. On the other hand, in a banking crisis caused by insolvency, that’s when you need to pump in money to rescue the institution.</p><p><b>What was the consensus about bank runs before Diamond and Dybvig began publishing their work?</b></p><p>There had been a lot of bank runs in the past and it was understood that financial crises were linked to them – particularly before the US Federal Reserve was founded in 1913. It was understood that bank runs made financial crises longer by exacerbating them. But the mechanism causing the bank runs wasn’t well understood.</p><p><b>How easy is it to tell what kind of bank run you are dealing with?</b></p><p>It’s not always easy. For example, in 2008 in Ireland it was thought to be a classic example of bank runs caused by liquidity fears. The state stepped up to give a blanket guarantee to creditors, but it then became apparent that the banks were really insolvent and the government had to inject enormous amounts of money into them, which led to a sovereign debt crisis.</p><p>Speaking of sovereign debt crises, the work by Diamond and Dybvig also underpins the literature on financial contagion, which is based on a 2000 paper by Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale. I worked with Allen and Gale for many years, and all our papers have been based on the work of Diamond, and Diamond and Dybvig.</p><p>In a similar way to how state reassurances can defuse a bank run caused by liquidity problems, we saw how the then European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was able to defuse the run on government bonds in the eurozone crisis in 2011 by saying that the bank would do “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro.</p><p><b>The prize announcement has attracted plenty of people on social media saying we shouldn’t be celebrating Bernanke when he was so involved in the quantitative easing (QE) that has helped to cause today’s global financial problems – what’s your view?</b></p><p>I would say that without QE our problems would today be much worse, but also that the prize recognises his achievements as an academic and not as chair of the Fed. Also, Bernanke was only one of the numerous central bankers who resorted to QE after 2008.</p><p>And it is not only the central bank actions that make banks stable. It’s also worth pointing out that the changes to the rules around the amount of capital that banks have to hold after 2008 have made the financial system much better protected against bank runs than it was beforehand.</p><p><b>Should such rules have been introduced when the academics first explained the risks around bank runs and contagion?</b></p><p>The literature had certainly hinted at these risks, but regulation-wise, we had to wait until after the global financial crisis to see reforms such as macro-prudential regulation and more stringent micro-prudential regulation. This shows that regulators were underestimating the risk of financial crises, perhaps also pushed by the banking lobbies that had been traditionally very powerful and managed to convince regulators that risks were well managed.</p><p><b>If retail banks become less important in future because of blockchain technology or central bank digital currencies, do you think the threat of financial panic will reduce?</b></p><p>If we are heading for a situation where depositors put their money into central banks rather than retail banks, that would diminish the role of retail banking, but I think we are far from that. Central bank digital currencies can be designed in such a way that retail banks are still necessary. But either way, the insights from Diamond and Dybvig about liquidity panics are still relevant because they apply to any context where coordination failures among investors are important, such as sovereign debt crises, currency attacks and so on.</p>"

            "content": "<p>Annie Ernaux was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature on October 6. The 82-year-old writer, whose sociological autofiction and memoir is influenced by Simone de Beauvoir and Pierre Bourdieu, is the first French woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature since the founding of the awards in 1901. Ernaux also becomes the 17th woman (among 119 Nobel Prize Laureates) to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p><p>This follows her 2019 shortlisting for the Man Booker International Prize for Literature, for The Years (translated by Alison Strayer, originally published in 2008), a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 – acclaimed in France as a modern In Search of Lost Time.</p><p>Considered the mother of contemporary sociological autofiction, Ernaux claims to write “something between literature, sociology and history”. To write “life”, she uses language as “a knife”. Her short, sparse, unlyrical, minimalist writing is wielded as a sharp weapon.</p><p><b>Voice of freedom</b></p><p>Her Nobel win is not a surprise. In 2021, she was widely named as a favourite to win the prestigious award. A fake Twitter account created by an Italian writer, Tommaso Debenedetti, had even announced her win in 2021 – a hoax that misled many. And in the days leading up to her award, online bookmakers ranked her as a favourite.</p><p>French president Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Ernaux as the voice of “the freedom of women and the forgotten [people] of the century”. He tweeted: “Annie Ernaux has been writing the novel of the collective and intimate memory of our country for 50 years.”</p><p>Born Annie Duchesne in 1940 in Normandie, Ernaux grew up working-class in a small town, Yvetot, where her parents ran a café–grocery shop. Her mother wanted the best education for her and pushed her to study. Ernaux was destined to become a teacher; she taught literature. She married into a bourgeois (middle-class) family. Her work explores her break with the world she grew up in, as she acquired cultural capital.</p><p>Building on the raw material of her diaries, Ernaux’s work reflects on her social trajectory, developing the ideas of “class betrayal” and “social shame”. She excavates how constant self-monitoring (for example, of language), for fear of being stigmatised, can create permanent feelings of social and cultural insecurity. She never spares her parents – nor herself.</p><p>Her books provide a mirror to readers who have experienced the same social gap, allowing them to (re)compose their personal and social identity. Her style is labelled “écriture blanche” (which literally translates as “white language”) – a language that doesn’t betray any social trend.</p><p>While Ernaux’s books draw on her own experience, sensations and emotions, her stories are never just her own. Her individual experiences represent collective ones – as Macron acknowledged after her win. She’s the author of 24 books, including 18 published in the prestigious Collection Blanche from French publisher house Gallimard.</p><p>The Swedish Academy praised her for “the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory.”</p><p><b>Unbelonging and obscenity</b></p><p>Ernaux made her literary debut in 1974 with a hard-hitting book, Cleaned Out, a fictionalised account of her own illegal abortion. The opening pages present the narrator, Denise Lesur, waiting in her university room for the outcome of her abortion.</p><p>As she wonders how all this happened, she retraces her journey through her rather happy childhood in a regional small town, her brilliant schooling and her entrance to university. Denise is actively supported by an ambitious mother who seeks social advancement for her – but she has the growing feeling of not belonging, of being an outsider.</p><p>A Frozen Woman (1981) builds on the same experience, but enlarges the scope to include marriage and maternity. The narrator marries into a bourgeois family; however, the bourgeoisie proves to be conservative and conformist. Marriage leads to domestic subjugation, which the narrator strongly denounces.</p><p>The following books, less violent in tone, elaborate on her parents. A Man’s Place (1984), for which Ernaux was awarded the prestigious Prix Renaudot, is dedicated to her working-class father. Ernaux paints his portrait in a series of subtle touches: poverty and a rough life, a move from the countryside to the city, the semi-success of his small business.</p><p>A Woman’s Story (1988) traces the different faces and life of her mother, who has Alzheimer’s disease, while exploring her own ambivalence towards her.</p><p>Two further books complicate this parental diptych. The first lines of Shame (1997), read as an echo of Camus’s The Outsider: “My father tried to kill my mother one Sunday in June, in the early afternoon.” I Remain in Darkness (1997) expands on her mother’s Alzheimer’s, and reflects on her death. It’s the work of a grieving daughter; the title is the last sentence her mother wrote. This book is the diary Ernaux wrote, expressing her pain and emotions on the spot, after each visit to her mother in the aged care home where she died.</p><p>Ernaux went on to explore her formative years. She revisited her abortion, this time as memoir rather than fiction, in Happening (2000). She wrote about her abrupt entry into a sexual life, aged 18, in A Girl’s Story (2016). And about the family secret – the death of her sister before she was born – in L'Autre Fille (2011) (The Other Girl).</p><p>A critically acclaimed film of Happening, directed by Audrey Diwan, won the Golden Lion at the 2021 Venice Film Festival, and premiered at the Alliance Française French Film Festival this year.</p><p>In other books, she investigates sexual addiction, desire and its satisfaction. Two narrate a short liaison with A., a Russian man: Simple Passion (1992) – adapted for a 2021 film directed by Danielle Arbid – and Getting Lost (2001). Simple Passion begins with Ernaux reflecting on watching her first pornographic film. That’s how we should write, she concludes – we should aim for “this impression provoked by the scene of the sexual act, this anguish and stupor, a suspension of moral judgement”.</p><p>The Possession (2002) recounts the end of her liaison with W., and her experience of jealousy. And L’Usage de la photo (The Uses of Photography), co-authored with Marc Marie, comments on 14 photographs taken by the co-authors, who are lovers. Ernaux’s most recent book, Le jeune homme (2022), recounts her relationship with a man 30 years younger than her.</p><p>Ernaux has sometimes been branded an obscene author – sexual obscenity adding to the social obscenity of being a “class defector”. She disrupts literary hierarchies, and deliberately writes “below literature” by delving into subjects that might have been considered unworthy of literature (such as abortion, masturbation, new suburbs, or supermarkets).</p><p>Regarde les lumières mon amour (2014), for instance, offers a diary of the time she spent in her local Auchan hypermarket. The Years, considered her masterpiece, offers a synthesis, where she “put[s] the world in words”. By referring to objects, words, songs and television programs, over a span of 65 years – combined with notes from her diaries – she captures a truth of her time. “It is both the story of my life and that of thousands of women who were also in search of freedom and emancipation,” she told Agence-France Press in May 2022.</p><p>Ernaux is a feminist, fed by Marxism, existentialism and phenomenology. She has enthusiastically observed the effects of the #metoo movement. “Women are no longer willing to let things happen to them,” she has said.</p><p>For Ernaux, writing is a political act. She says the Nobel prize is “a very great honour” but also “a great responsibility” – one she was given in order to bear witness, on behalf of “justice and righteousness”.</p><p>In May 2022, at the Cannes Film Festival, Ernaux presented Les Années Super 8, a film she co-directed with her son David Ernaux-Briot. It’s a delicate journey into the life of a French family, compiled from home movie images filmed from 1972 to 1981.</p><p>And it’s another way of entering Ernaux’s world – our world.</p>"

Just starting right here in our own solar system, we have a star, eight planets, five dwarf planets, and more than 200 moons. That's a lot to take in. Going out from there, our home galaxy contains more than we, in our biological brains, can ever process. Estimates hold that the Milky Way possesses upwards of 300 billion stars. Assuming our solar system is fairly run-of-the-mill, that equates to on the order of a trillion planets, easy, and something like 60 trillion moons, in our galaxy alone. (Pause here to let the brain catch up.)</p>\n<p>Now if that weren't enough to boggle, consider that the universe is estimated to contain roughly, oh, a trillion galaxies. Lest making sense of such multitudes seem more than humans are capable of, though, all those commas and zeroes actually boil down to a comparatively very manageable set of physical principles&mdash;the laws of nature, which number less than a handful: electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. These four laws, acting across all of the universe from the very smallest to the very largest scales, determine how it all works. The power of mathematics&mdash;for instance via statistics, where a representative sample can tell us about the unassessable total&mdash;further enables researchers to corral the vastness of existence. These approaches of physics and mathematics&mdash;fleshed out further in fields such as astrophysics and cosmology, and exercised by researchers at Kavli Astrophysics Institutes, with ever-greater instruments and theoretical frameworks&mdash;are continuing to make the once-unknowable, knowable.</p>\n<p>Recently, Kavli Institute-affiliated researchers have put out results and discussion on a rich array of subjects, from the primordial periods of the universe to considering the odds of intelligent life here in our Milky Way. Piecemeal, these researchers and their colleagues worldwide are making the depth and the breadth accessible and comprehendible.</p>\n<h4>A lot to be desired in deciphering black holes' spins</h4>\n<p>A key way that researchers expect to learn about the origin of black hole binaries&mdash;pairs of black holes closely orbiting each other before eventually merging&mdash;is by measuring the spin of the extreme objects. That spin speaks to the formation of the black hole duo. The favored formation pathways are either from a pair of massive stars that orderly orbited each other before collapsing into black holes, or two separate black holes that crossed paths in a jumbled star cluster. Spin rates of nearly 70 of these binary systems have been catalogued to date, suggesting ample examples for this determination of origin.

The MKI scientists showed that plugging in the known data yields different results based on models and assumptions used; accordingly, there is not a reliable way to infer the constituent objects' spins. In time, though, accumulating observations will help refine the models and should lead to a firmer understanding.</p>\n<h4>Bringing the missing matter in the universe to light</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ipmu.jp/en/20221227-eROSITA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A recent study</a><span>&nbsp;</span>coauthored by a researcher at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (Kavli IPMU) at Tokyo University is helping to solve the so-called missing baryon problem. Baryons, such as protons and neutrons, are the \"normal\" matter in the universe. Although theoretically making up only about 5% of the universe's total mass-energy, a significant portion of these baryons still remain unaccounted for. Much of the missing matter is thought to be in the form of a hot plasma that filamentously connects galaxies; however, observing this speculated matter has proven difficult. Using old and new data from x-ray telescopes in space, researchers are starting to stack up observations of x-rays emitted by these filaments, helping to fill in the missing baryon gap. More than a mere clerical cleanup, accounting for this missing matter will help further refine galactic evolution and formation models.</p>\n<h4>Challenging prevailing cosmological theories with JWST</h4>\n<p>JWST, the most powerful telescope of its kind to ever ply the skies, has already gathered some surprising data over just its first year of service. JWST has, for instance, let us peer back deeper than ever before into the early universe, where the telescope has seen unexpected oodles of bright, well-developed, large galaxies merely a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/standard-model-of-cosmology-survives-jwsts-surprising-finds-20230120/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A story at<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Quanta Magazine</em><span>&nbsp;</span>covers this exciting development</a>, quoting researchers at MKI and the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics (KICP) at the University of Chicago. At first glance, these gobsmacking galaxies would seem to severely challenge cosmological theories about the how and when galaxies first formed. Some of the galaxies have turned out though, upon further calibration and examination, to be not quite as distant and therefore theoretical envelope-pushing. Others may instead turn out to be new kinds of dusty galaxies, masquerading as more distant, developed ones. That said, though, at least four galaxies have had their extreme distances strongly confirmed, putting theorists in a pickle. One possibility is that the relation between stars' brightnesses and their masses&mdash;gathered from studies of the more modern universe&mdash;may be significantly different in the earliest cosmic times. Another x-factor is that early developing black holes could be gobbling up matter and making early galaxies appear brighter than expected. Only time, and more observations with JWST, will sort this brewing mystery out.</p>\n<h4>Identifying the responsible parties for a major cosmic sea change</h4>\n<p>Via its deepest-ever dives into cosmic history, JWST is also further helping explain a profound change the universe underwent known as reionization. After the cosmos initially cooled down from the Big Bang, neutral (non-ionized) atoms of mostly hydrogen could at last form. These atoms then collected in billions upon billions of batches to form the first generation of stars and galaxies. These stars, in turn, emitted high-energy radiation that re-ionized the vast medium of remaining ambient gas in the universe. Researchers at Kavli IPMU<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.ipmu.jp/en/20230113-GLASS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">are studying early galaxies and their constituent stars</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to assess how this reionization unfolded. The work involves comparing galaxy size to galaxy luminosity in those primordial epochs. The efforts are offering a better sense of the kinds and numbers of the galactic sources necessary and responsible for reionization.</p>\n<h4>Gauging the likelihood of alien life (and not via blurry UFOs)</h4>\n<p>In a new Research Highlight, Jack Singal, a former member of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) at Stanford University,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://kipac.stanford.edu/highlights/aliens-could-be-out-there-dont-trust-clickbait\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tackles the profound question of whether we are alone in the universe.</a><span>&nbsp;</span>Singal&mdash;who gave a KIPAC public lecture on the topic last year&mdash;picks up on the headline-generating releases in 2021 of footage declassified by the Pentagon allegedly depicting UFOs. The grainy, ambiguous footage, however, stands in contrast to genuine, verifiable knowledge we have gathered in recent years, Singal points out, about the actual likelihood of alien life existing in our galaxy. Continuing discoveries of exoplanets&mdash;worlds around other stars&mdash;and our increasing understanding of them is moving the state of the science forward at a rapid pace. Given all we already know, it is safe to say that worlds hosting plausible habitats for life as we know it should exist by the billions in the Milky Way Galaxy alone, Singal says. Just how common intelligent life is, though, remains harder to gauge. But given the evidence, for instance, that biological brains have evolved at least three different times on Earth alone suggests intelligence may not be rare, either.</p>"

At the Kavli Energy NanoScience Institute at UC Berkeley, researchers have found a way to mechanically interlink millions of molecules, opening the door to materials that flex and stiffen in response to different stimuli. At the Kavli Institute at Cornell for Nanoscale Science, researchers have discovered a way to vary a crystal&rsquo;s symmetry&mdash;and its electronic, optical, and other properties&mdash;using tiny amounts of voltage. We also feature a discussion about a table-top experiment to measure quantum gravity, how artificial intelligence can be applied to help in the production of nanomedicines, and new insights into the complexity of bacterial membranes actually work.</p>\n<h4>Probing where the quantum world begins</h4>\n<p>We all know that the laws that govern the quantum world differ from those that enable us to predict what occurs in our everyday life. But we know surprisingly little about how these two worlds interact at their interface. One way to discover more is to attempt to unify quantum physics with the macroscopic world of gravity and space. That is the topic of discussion between Rana Adhikari, a member of the Kavli Nanoscience Institute at Caltech, and Kathryn Zurek, a theoretical physicist at the same institute. Along with collaborators, they are building a table-top experiment to detect the signatures of quantum gravity. Why gravity? Today, quantum theory does a good job explaining such fundamental forces as electromagnetism (which we see in the macro world) and the strong and weak forces that govern the behavior of subatomic particles at the quantum level in ways that have macro repercussions. Gravity, however, remains an outlier. We can see and measure it in the macro world, but no one has found evidence of it at the quantum level. Adhikari and Zurek hope to see artifacts of quantum gravity by looking for small-scale ripples in spacetime. The experiment itself works a bit like LIGO, the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatories operated by Caltech and MIT, but at a much smaller scale. To learn more about this remarkable quest, listen to<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/ask-expert-quantum/quantum-gravity-adhikari-zurek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Caltech&rsquo;s 45-minute interview</a><span>&nbsp;</span>with Adhikari and Zurek.</p>\n<p><iframe height=\"500\"  width=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uRgXsRYUDhI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<h4>One step to molecular &ldquo;chain mail&rdquo; sheets</h4>\n<p>Seven years ago, French chemist Jean-Pierre Sauvage shared a Nobel Prize for synthesizing the first catenane, which consisted of two chemical rings interlocked with one another mechanically, not unlike medieval chain mail. Since they were not locked in place by chemical bonds, they could move freely yet still retain the strength and stiffness of the original molecules. Researchers speculated that sheets of catenanes would make excellent reinforcements for composites without the brittleness of conventional fracture-prone reinforcing fibers. Unfortunately, catenanes are hard to synthesize: adding each ring took an entirely new chemical reaction. Now, a research team led by Omar Yaghi, codirector of the Kavli Energy NanoScience Institute at UC Berkeley, has found a way to<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/01/18/new-chain-mail-material-of-interlocking-molecules-is-tough-flexible-and-easy-to-make/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">synthesize millions of interlocked catenanes with a single chemical step</a>. The work, which builds on Yaghi&rsquo;s covalent organic frameworks (COFs), synthesizes two boomerang-shaped molecules covalently bonded to a copper atom where they cross. The synthesis process yields a porous 3-D network of interlocking polyhedral molecules whose six arms interlock to form an extended framework. By chemically modifying the molecules, Yaghi believes he can not only make good reinforcements, but create systems that flex or stiffen in response to different stimuli.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cms.kavlifoundation.org/uploads/chainmail-Yaghi750px.jpg\" data-image=\"81703\" />The individual building blocks of a catenane are polyhedral molecules &mdash; a type of adamantane &mdash; that link arms to form a 2D mesh or 3D network that is sturdy but flexible. (Image credit: Tianqiong Ma, UC Berkeley)</p>\n<h4>Switch crystal symmetry with the flip of a switch</h4>\n<p>For the first time, researchers have shown that they can<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2023/01/researchers-flip-switch-electric-control-crystal-symmetry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vary a crystal&rsquo;s symmetry&mdash;and its electronic, optical and other properties&mdash;using voltage</a>. Until now, voltage has broken or removed symmetry, rather than switched it. The breakthrough could lead to entirely new classes of low-power, nonvolatile semiconductors for computer memory and logic devices. Two Kavli Institute at Cornell for Nanoscale Science (KIC) members were senior leaders on the project: Darrell Schlom, who produced the materials in his lab, and KIC co-director David Muller, who used his ground-breaking electron microscope pixel array detector (EMPAD) system to image atoms and elucidate the polar and nonpolar phases of material. The material itself consists of a few atomic layers of bismuth ferrite, a ferroelectric with the highest polarization of any known material, and terbium scandate, which is not a ferroelectric. Because each layer of the superlattice is so thin, it has a major influence on the other layer. By adjusting layer thickness, the researchers perfectly balance these influences. This enables a small electric current to trigger a large change in symmetry. This boosts bismuth ferrite&rsquo;s resistivity by five orders of magnitude, turning it into a semiconductor from an insulator, and changes the superlattice&rsquo;s nonlinear optical response by more than three orders of magnitude. Next, researchers plan to investigate the material&rsquo;s magnetic response.</p>\n<h4>AI drives nanomedicine engineering</h4>\n<p>What happens when you apply artificial intelligence to nanomedicine engineering? The National Science Foundation has awarded $3 million to Kavli Institute at Cornell member Nicholas Abbot, an expert in liquid crystals, and Cornell Rong Yang, an AI researcher, to find out. Today, nanoparticles are an emerging but problematic element in the development of targeted drugs. Pharmaceutical makers attach medicines to chemically modified nanoparticles that bind to specific tissues in the body. It may take years or even decades to develop ways to manufacture these particles consistently and at scale; but Yang believes AI could help simplify this process, but better data on these tiny molecules is needed. Enter Abbot, who will use the optical properties of liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) to provide the data Yang needs. The approach is to dissolve the nanoparticles in LCPs, which are used in optical displays. As the two materials interact,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2023/01/engineers-advance-nanomedicine-manufacturing-using-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the optical response of the LCPs will provide data about nanoparticle</a>molecular weight, size, and morphology. That information will be used by AI algorithms to better model how to synthesize the nanoparticles during assembly.</p>\n<h4>Rethinking bacterial membranes</h4>\n<p>Until recently, biologists assumed the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria consisted of a gel-like layer of lipids containing randomly distributed proteins. Now that researchers can image live cells, such as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>E. coli</em>, they are finding that this is not the case. Instead, the proteins on bacterial surfaces sit in the center of hexagonal-like lipid structures. This is interesting because bacterial membranes do more than just hold the cell together and let in nutrients and expel waste. They also are the organism&rsquo;s first line of defense, ejecting antibiotics, hydrolyzing antimicrobial peptides, and controlling adherence to surfaces to form colonies. Understanding membranes could help researchers develop more effective antibiotics.<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/zKmSQTPMyKs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">In a recent video</a>, Abraham Oluwole of the Kavli Institute for Nanoscience Discovery at the University of Oxford interviewed his collaborator, Melissa Webby, about her four-year program to probe the nature of these outer layer membranes. Since proteins and lipids respond very differently to advanced measurement techniques, it took a lot of collaboration among Kavli members and other Oxford researchers to unravel the mysteries of these biochemical systems.</p>"

The courage, creativity and perseverance of the Nobel Laureates inspire us and give us hope for the future. Films, in-depth tours, and artefacts tell the stories of the Laureates and their contributions ‘for the greatest benefit to humankind’. Based on the Nobel Prize’s unique combination of fields – natural sciences, literature and peace – we examine the greatest challenges of our time and show how we can respond to them through science, humanism and collaboration. With our exhibitions, school programmes, lectures and conversations, we at the Nobel Prize Museum strive to engage the public in making a better world. Today we are located at Stortorget in Gamla Stan, Stockholm’s Old Town district. We are planning to create a new home for our public outreach activities at Slussen in downtown Stockholm.</span></p>\n<p style=\"\"line-height: 115%; background: white; margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"\"><span style=\"\"font-family: Times; color: black;\"\"> </span></p>\n<p style=\"\"line-height: 115%; background: white; margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"\"><span style=\"\"font-family: Times; color: black;\"\">Disclaimer: Nobel Prize Museum is not directly or indirectly involved in the process of nominating or selecting Nobel Prize laureates.
